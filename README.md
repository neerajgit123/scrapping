# Introduction

This project demonstrates web scraping and data manipulation using Python. It retrieves data from a specific webpage and extracts the required information. The extracted data is then stored in a CSV or Excel file.

Project is written with python 3.11.4 in mind.
### virtualenv

This assumes that `python3` is linked to valid installation of python 3 and that `pip` is installed and `pip3`is valid
for installing python 3 packages.

Installing inside virtualenv is recommended, however you can start your project without virtualenv too.


# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com/USERNAME/{{ project_name }}.git
    $ cd {{ project_name }}
    
Activate the virtualenv for your project.
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
Then simply run the temprature_scrapping.py:
    $ python temprature_scrapping.py
